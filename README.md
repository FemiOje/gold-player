# Gold Player
A first-person player controller for Unity, built with being user-friendly and developer friendly in mind.

## What?
Gold Player aims to be an easy to use first person player controller for your Unity games. Its goal is to work with as many first-person games as possible without the need to modify much code if any. So be it if it's a horror game, puzzle game or first-person shooter; it should *just work*!

## Why?
I feel like the standard controllers provided by Unity is REALLY bad, like seriously bad. So I once set out to create a player controller that I could use in multiple projects without the need of editing the code for it. It worked fine at first but it was full of bad practices and bugs. So I used my new knowledge to create a new one and it went really good. It even got used in [a game I published](https://hertzole.itch.io/jumps)! But I once started a major refactor and I never finished it and I left it in a weird place. Half good, half really bad. And since that, my coding style has evolved even more. So I wanted to make "the ultimate controller" with all the knowledge I already have and fix stupid problems from the get-go. 

## How do I use it?
Right now the only way to get the full package is to download the entire repository. I will have releases later on whenever I feel like fits for a release. __And right now nothing really works. The start is there, but all the things that make a player controller aren't.__ It's in VERY early development and a lot may/will change, __so use at your own risk!__ But I will mark old stuff as obsolete and then remove it in a version later on, so you won't get a bunch of errors for each new version! But stuff added in between versions can be removed, so keep that in mind if you're using the code directly from the repository! 

## What can I expect?
I have several things I want to do with this player controller. Right now I just need to get it moving, but here are some things I will add in the not so distant future!
- Crouching
- Head bob
- Audio for footsteps, landing, and jumping
- Extra components (stuff that could help you make your game and hooks into the player)
- Built-in camera shake
- ~~Rewired input~~ Replaced by new Unity input system.
- Intergrate the [new Unity Input System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem) (when it becomes more stable).
- Easy to use API
Those are just some things I can think of right now. I will, of course, add more stuff as time goes on!

### Q&A
Q: Why the name 'Gold Player'?  
A: I'm a big fan of the player controller is [GoldSrc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldSrc) engine and I want to make a player controller that feels just as good, so I went with "Gold Player".

Q: Why open source?  
A: I had my other two player controllers closed source, but I treated them as open source with documentation and such, so I thought it would be fun to make it open source and it could help someone looking for a solid player controller!

Q: Plans to port it outside of Unity?  
A: Nope. Probably never will. I'm too much of a Unity fanboy.

Q: Can I use this for my project?  
A: Yes! No restrictions! You can do whatever you want with it. The only thing you can't do is directly reselling my player controller.
